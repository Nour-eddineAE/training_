I frequently use **cout** for debugging purposes, and typing out the same statements repeatedly can be tedious. To address this, I've created a dedicated directory to organize these debug statements.
I could have employed a generic class for this purpose, but i often find myself copying and pasting the debug methods directly into the specific problem contexts. Therefore, utilizing a generic class would not be practical.
Furthermore, I aim to avoid having dependencies between directories.
