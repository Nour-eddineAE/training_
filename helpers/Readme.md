I frequently use **cout** for debugging purposes, and typing out the same statements repeatedly can be tedious. <br/>
To address this, i've created a dedicated directory to organize these debug statements.<br/>

I could have employed a generic class for this purpose, but i often find myself copying and pasting the debug methods directly into the specific problem contexts.<br/>

Therefore, utilizing a generic class would not be practical. Furthermore, I aim to avoid having dependencies between directories.
