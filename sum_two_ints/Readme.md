# Problem

Given two linked lists l1 and l2 representing each an integer, we want to return the result of their sum in a linked list in reversed order.

## examples:

### input

-   l1 = 9 -> 9
-   l2 = 1

### output

-   0 -> 0 -> 1

### explanation

-   99 + 1 = 100 => we represent each digit in a node
