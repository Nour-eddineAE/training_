Welcome to my "training\_" GitHub repository! Here, I actively contribute to the programming community by sharing my solutions to various problems.

While the repository may not have a formal or professional appearance, it serves as a platform to showcase my problem-solving skills in C++, Python, and JavaScript.

Each directory within this repository represents a unique problem, and you'll find solutions implemented in one or more of the mentioned programming languages. Accompanying each solution is a markdown file that describes the problem statement, enabling others to understand the challenge and use the provided solutions as a reference or source of inspiration.

I must acknowledge that my solutions are not exempt from errors, and they may not always represent the most optimized approaches. To foster growth and improvement, I encourage the visitor to actively contribute and suggest enhancements by creating pull requests. Together, we can create a valuable resource for aspiring developers to learn and enhance their problem-solving skills.

Thank you for visiting my repository, and I sincerely hope you find the content useful and engaging. Happy coding!
