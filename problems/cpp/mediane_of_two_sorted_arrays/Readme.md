# Problem

Given two sorted arrays, we want to calculate their mediane[the mediane of the merged array].
The challenge is to solve it in a runtime of O(log(n+m))

## examples:

### input

-   arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 7]
-   arr2 = [3, 4]

### output

-   3
-   merged array: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 7] => mediane = (3+3)/2 = 3
